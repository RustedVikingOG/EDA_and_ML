# Data Science Project: From Data Cleaning to ML Deployment

Welcome to my comprehensive data science project, which spans data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning (ML) on a dummy dataset. This project showcases my skill set in transforming raw data into actionable insights and predictive models.

## Project Overview

The project is structured to demonstrate a complete data science workflow:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Starting with raw data, this phase focuses on handling missing values, detecting and removing outliers, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Deep diving into the cleaned data to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights through visualizations and statistical analysis.
3. **Machine Learning (ML)**: Building and evaluating predictive models based on insights gathered from EDA, aiming for actionable results.

## Installation

Clone this repository and install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure
- README.md - Guides you through the project.
- /data - Contains raw, intermediate, and processed datasets.
- /notebooks - Jupyter notebooks for each project phase:
  - 01_data_cleaning_and_preprocessing.ipynb - Demonstrates the data cleaning process.
  - 02_data_exploration.ipynb - Focuses on EDA.
  - 03_machine_learning_model.ipynb - Showcases the ML model development.
- /src - Python scripts for data cleaning, preprocessing, EDA, and ML modeling.
- /tests - Unit tests for data cleaning and preprocessing functions.
- requirements.txt - Project dependencies.
- .gitignore - Specifies files to ignore in version control.

## Usage
1. Begin with the 01_data_cleaning_and_preprocessing.ipynb notebook to understand how the data is prepared.
2. Explore the 02_data_exploration.ipynb for insights into the dataset.
3. Dive into 03_machine_learning_model.ipynb to see how predictive models are built and evaluated.
