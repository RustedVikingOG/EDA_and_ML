# Data Science Project: Exploratory Data Analysis & Machine Learning on a Dummy Dataset
Welcome to my data science project, where we dive deep into exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning (ML) using a dummy dataset. This project is designed to showcase my data science skills, including data cleaning, visualization, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling.

## Project Overview
This project aims to apply comprehensive EDA techniques to a dummy dataset, extract meaningful insights, and then use those insights to build a predictive machine learning model. The goal is to demonstrate the ability to handle data effectively and apply ML techniques to produce actionable results.

## Installation
To run this project, you will need Python and several Python libraries. The easiest way to get started is to install Anaconda, which includes all the necessary libraries, or you can install Python and the required libraries individually.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure
- README.md - This file.
- /data - Contains the raw and processed datasets.
  - raw_data.csv - The original dummy dataset.
  - processed_data.csv - The cleaned and preprocessed dataset.
- /notebooks - Jupyter notebooks for EDA and ML modeling.
  - 01_data_exploration.ipynb - Notebook for exploratory data analysis.
  - 02_machine_learning_model.ipynb - Notebook for building and evaluating the ML model.
- /src - Python scripts for data preprocessing, EDA, and modeling.
  - data_preprocessing.py - Script for data cleaning and preprocessing.
  - exploratory_data_analysis.py - Script for performing EDA.
  - model.py - Script for ML model.
- /tests - Contains tests for data preprocessing.
  - test_data_preprocessing.py - Test script for data preprocessing.
- requirements.txt - Required Python libraries.
- .gitignore - Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.


## Usage
To explore the project:

1. Start by reading through the 01_data_exploration.ipynb Jupyter notebook to understand the EDA process.
2. Proceed to the 02_machine_learning_model.ipynb notebook to see the ML model building and evaluation process.
3. You can run the scripts in /src for a more in-depth look at the data preprocessing, EDA, and modeling logic.
